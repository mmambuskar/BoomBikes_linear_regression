## Table of Contents
* We are predicting the future count for the BoomBikes
* For the prediction we used the ML model - Multiple linear Regression
* Using the some data from contained information we can prdict the count 

<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## General Information
- We used the BoomBikes organization data to predict the future uses of count
- We have count the the total number depend upon fetures
